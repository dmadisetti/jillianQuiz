		Wavelet analysis of periodic error for improved displacement metrology
	</h1>
	Displacement interferometer is a critical metrology capability for applications requiring nanometer positioning accuracy. One inherent accuracy limitation is the periodic error, caused by frequency mixing in systems with two frequencies. This error is typically quantified using a Fourier transform-based analysis of constant velocity motions. In practice, however, non-constant velocity profiles lead to non-stationary signal requiring alternate analysis techniques for real-time compensation. In this project, we will gain new fundamental insight into periodic error and its compensation by applying wavelet analysis techniques to characterize the non-stationary, time-varying error caused by frequency mixing.

		Additive Manufacturing for Precision End-Use Functional Parts
	</h1>
	The hypothesis this research looks to explore is the possibility of using additive manufacturing technologies to produce functional end-use components for precision applications. This will lead to new knowledge surrounding the design of components manufactured using additive processes, the mechanical properties of the materials produced by these technologies, and ideas for improvement of the processes. So far, we have designed and built a flexural fatigue test machine that meets the ASTM D7774-12 specification for fatigue tests. This will be used to develop fatigue models and analysis of the additive manufactured materials.  This data along with the mechanical properties of the materials will then be fed into the design of the precision components. The additive nature of these processes will allow for more freedom in design than typical manufacturing processes, the extent of these freedoms will be explored during the design process. The designs will then be analyzed using FEA software to determine the expected life and performance.  Once a specified design has been chosen, the components will be manufactured and tested to determine the performance of the materials and their correlation with the fatigue models and design criteria developed.

		3D printable ultralow cost sensors and actuators
	</h1>
	This is aiming for the 3D printing process to make functional sensors and actuators almost out of the polymeric materials at the micro-and-nano scales. This technology has the possibility to change the prosthetic, robotic and medical in the future. Our ultimate goal is to make sensors and actuators ultralow cost while it satisfies the functional requirements fully.  Here we are making displacement sensors, gyro sensors, and flexure stages by using Fused Deposition Model and Stereolithography machines.

		Automated toolpath planning for multi-axis machining
	</h1>
	This is aiming for creating an optimized toolpath by voxelized model of a part. When a process engineer creates a tool path, a number of fixed decisions are made that inevitably produce sub-optimal results. This is because it is impossible to process all of the available information and tradeoffs a priori. The increase of such information is overwhelming and is typically not used to its fullest extent. Optimal tool paths ideally meet the conflicting objectives of cost, speed, and quality. Automation of this process is necessary to propel machining into the next era of manufacturing. The research will present a methodology to support a process engineerâ€™s attempt to create optimal tool paths by performing automated digital machining and tool path analysis. This methodology automatically generates and evaluates tool paths based on parallel processing of volumetric digital part models. 

	After converting all the possible tools and the model in a digital format, the methodology is supposed to generate lots of possible toolpaths for all the available tools. Then the metrics for each toolpath is calculated and the best toolpath for input parameters (time, surface quality, etc) will be chosen. This methodology is a parallel processing accelerated framework suitable for generating tool paths in parallel enabling the process engineer to rank and select the best tool path for the job.
